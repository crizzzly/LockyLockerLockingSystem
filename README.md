#Locky Locker Locking System

###Abstract
In our lab we are in the situation that we have a lot of lockers with many keys. Some of the lockers should be available for all students of our course of studies, some just for lecturers and academic staff.
So almost every day we have to search through a bunch of keys to get the one fitting to the locker we want to open.

So we decided to build a system which allows us to unlock the locker(s) with any RFID enabled card or even our mobile phones.
